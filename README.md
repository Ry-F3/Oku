## **Background**

Project Oku is a crypto calculator designed to address the needs of traders in the cryptocurrency market. It aims to provide users with the tools to evaluate price targets and calculate the value of their assets. This readme file serves as a guide to understanding the purpose and functionality of Project Oku.

**Market Dynamics and the Need for a Price Target Crypto Calculator:**<br>
Financial markets, including the cryptocurrency market, operate in cycles characterized by periods of bullish and bearish sentiment. Greed drives the market during bull runs, while fear dominates during bearish periods. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, many individuals seek quick wealth without fully understanding the underlying mathematics and technical analysis.

Oku aims to fill this gap by offering a comprehensive calculator specifically tailored for the cryptocurrency market. By incorporating essential factors such as circulating supply and market capitalization, the calculator assists traders in setting realistic price targets and making informed investment decisions based on quantitative analysis.

**Understanding Circulating Supply and Market Capitalization:**<br>
When analyzing a digital currency, it is crucial to consider its circulating supply and whether it is capped or not. This distinction determines whether the currency is deflationary, like Bitcoin with a limited supply, or inflationary, similar to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. Fiat currencies can be continuously printed through policies like quantitative easing and are not backed by gold.

**To calculate the price of a cryptocurrency, divide its market capitalization by the circulating supply:**<br>

Price = Market Cap / Circulating Supply

**Conversely, to determine the market capitalization, multiply the price by the circulating supply:**<br>

Market Cap = Price x Circulating Supply

These formulas provide valuable insights into the valuation and potential growth of a given cryptocurrency, enabling users to assess its market position and set reasonable price targets.

**Calculating Asset Value:**<br>
Oku also offers a feature that allows users to input their assets and calculate their total value. This feature assists users in understanding the current worth of their holdings. While an ideal future addition would be the ability to email this information to the user, it may require further research and development to implement.

**User Driven:**<br>
Oku provides a valuable tool for traders in the cryptocurrency market by offering a comprehensive calculator for price targets and asset value calculations. By considering factors such as circulating supply and market capitalization, users can set realistic price targets and make informed investment decisions. Project Oku empowers users to engage in quantitative analysis, enhance their understanding of cryptocurrency investments, and effectively manage their portfolios.



## **Scope**

**User Interface:** <br> The calculator will have a user-friendly interface where users can input relevant data such as circulating supply, market capitalization, and desired price targets. A well-designed interface will enhance user experience and ease of data input.

**Calculation Logic:** <br> The JavaScript code will incorporate the formulas for price calculations, considering market capitalization and circulating supply. The logic should be accurate and efficient, handling different input scenarios and providing appropriate results.

**Error Handling:** <br> The calculator should account for potential errors or invalid inputs, providing error messages or validation checks to guide users and ensure accurate calculations.

**Flexibility and Customisation:** <br> Consider allowing users to customise parameters according to their specific cryptocurrencies or investment strategies. This flexibility will enhance the usability and applicability of the calculator for a wide range of cryptocurrencies.

**Mobile Responsiveness:** <br> Ensure that the calculator is responsive and compatible with different screen sizes and devices, allowing users to access and utilise it conveniently on both desktop and mobile platforms.

**Testing and Validation:** <br> Thoroughly test the calculator's functionality and validate the results against known values. Implement unit tests to ensure accurate calculations and a reliable user experience.

By considering these factors and implementing the necessary functionalities, the JavaScript-based Project, Oku calculator will provide traders with a valuable tool for evaluating price targets and calculating asset values in a variety of markets.
