## **Background**

Project Oku is a crypto calculator designed to address the needs of traders in the cryptocurrency market. It aims to provide users with the tools to evaluate price targets and calculate the value of their assets. This readme file serves as a guide to understanding the purpose and functionality of Project Oku.

**Market Dynamics and the Need for a Price Target Crypto Calculator:**<br>
Financial markets, including the cryptocurrency market, operate in cycles characterized by periods of bullish and bearish sentiment. Greed drives the market during bull runs, while fear dominates during bearish periods. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, many individuals seek quick wealth without fully understanding the underlying mathematics and technical analysis.

Project Oku aims to fill this gap by offering a comprehensive calculator specifically tailored for the cryptocurrency market. By incorporating essential factors such as circulating supply and market capitalization, the calculator assists traders in setting realistic price targets and making informed investment decisions based on quantitative analysis.

**Understanding Circulating Supply and Market Capitalization:**<br>
When analyzing a digital currency, it is crucial to consider its circulating supply and whether it is capped or not. This distinction determines whether the currency is deflationary, like Bitcoin with a limited supply, or inflationary, similar to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. Fiat currencies can be continuously printed through policies like quantitative easing and are not backed by gold.

**To calculate the price of a cryptocurrency, divide its market capitalization by the circulating supply:**<br>

Price = Market Cap / Circulating Supply

**Conversely, to determine the market capitalization, multiply the price by the circulating supply:**<br>

Market Cap = Price x Circulating Supply

These formulas provide valuable insights into the valuation and potential growth of a given cryptocurrency, enabling users to assess its market position and set reasonable price targets.

**Calculating Asset Value:**<br>
Project Oku also offers a feature that allows users to input their assets and calculate their total value. This feature assists users in understanding the current worth of their holdings. While an ideal future addition would be the ability to email this information to the user, it may require further research and development to implement.

**User Driven:**<br>
Project Oku provides a valuable tool for traders in the cryptocurrency market by offering a comprehensive calculator for price targets and asset value calculations. By considering factors such as circulating supply and market capitalization, users can set realistic price targets and make informed investment decisions. Project Oku empowers users to engage in quantitative analysis, enhance their understanding of cryptocurrency investments, and effectively manage their portfolios.
